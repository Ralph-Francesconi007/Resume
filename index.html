      <p class="about-style">
        Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a passion for self-improvement and a strong work ethic that is derived from years of teamwork in both sports and my education. I love to help people, and I enjoy being able to cement my skills by reviewing topics with others. I have great hand-eye coordination and, in my spare time, I like to practice typing and see how many words I can write without looking at the keyboard.</p>
